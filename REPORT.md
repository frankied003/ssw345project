# Problem Statement 
Weather can be unpredictable. Weather technology has been improving, but mother nature always has the upper hand. When planning on going out in town, usually individuals check the current weather on their phone to see what the current weather is and what it may soon be. They look at numbers and that’s basically it. This is where WeatherNot comes in.

WeatherNot is a Discord bot that utilizes weather APIs to give users a detailed description of the weather through text and recommendations for what to wear for the day. As stated before, weather apps only give numbers, sometimes not enough data or too much data, and can be unorganized. The problem with this, is that the weather is constantly changing. There are multiple factors that can cause the current weather to shift, such as a passing storm that drops several inches of rain in an area in just a few minutes. WeatherNot utilizes a simple input structure to give the user what they want and a little more. The bot uses past and current data to predict the clothing for weather for the specific area based on zip code. The bot is able to do this because it doesn’t simply look at raw data, but rather interprets it in a unique way. This is why WeatherNot uses a combination of the current conditions and a series of algorithms to predict the clothing for the weather for the morning, evening, and night.

# Future Work 
In the future, we hope to implement a feature where users can get clothing recommendations for the morning, evening, and night.  Right now the bot allows users to get the clothing recommendations based on the weather in that specific area at that specific time.  We hope to implement a feature that will show clothing recommendations for the whole day incase there is unpredictable weather such as rain later in the day to let the user know they will need to wear a hoodie or bring an umbrella.
