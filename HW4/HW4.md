**HW 4 Reflection**

**Design**
1.	The most helpful aspect of design method that we were utilizing was discord being clean and simple. To design the bot, we wanted minimal heavy transactions and calls to the backend as well. With discord and our code being fast and organized, it was easy to build out features.
2.	The most difficult part was figuring out how to display the clothing recommendations in the correct way or a nice way. Since there are different screen sizes in discord we wanted to make sure the message looked good for every screen. We would like to spend more time on user testing if possible, because of this design aspect. It’s important that the bot works as intended, but also looks good!
3.	I would love to do more user testing / questioning for the design aspect of the project.

**Implementation**
1.	The discord API was really easy to use and had a lot of documentation. This was definitely the most helpful tool for implementing and testing our bot. Additionally, the community on discord’s developer server is great.
2.	The most difficult aspect was figuring out the best way to parse the weather data and return accurate clothing recommendations. We wanted to do this in a way where it’s not a massive amount of Boolean statements, but rather a dynamic approach where rain on one day is not the same recommendation as rain on another day.
3.	We would love to integrate some Natural Language Processing or machine learning if we were going to continue this project. This would be great for inputting a message to the bot and understanding what the customer is asking rather than typing in a simple command. Additionally, the clothing recommendation responses will be much more dynamic since it can learn from past data and recognize the best clothing to wear.

**Process**
1.	The Kanban board was extremely helpful. More than the code reviews in my opinion. Keeping track of the tasks was important, especially with multiple developers coding on the same repo, different branches, different times, etc. With the Kanban board, we had to a plan of what tasks to do and prioritized them extremely well. After a task was done, we would make a pull request review the code, and merge it into the master branch. 
2.	Most difficult was merging pull requests. We had this one issue where there was a merge conflict, ended up picking the wrong change, and it messed some other branches up when we pull from master without double checking if the merge was de-bugged. Next time, we will make sure that merge, after merge conflicts are decided upon, is tested and then pushed to master branch.
3.	Kanban board has always been my favorite for projects like this. Even on personal projects, it’s super important to have task management especially if there are multiple developers or just a lot of tasks. This goes for code reviews as well, but mostly for team developing.

**Overall**
In my opinion, all these design, implementation, and software methods are important to work together as one. I haven’t been apart of a project that didn’t use all three in some way or another. Especially in the professional world, without these three aspects of developing a product, something will go wrong. You must have a design plan, a task manger, and implementation methods with a big team.
